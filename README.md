# asset-swap-and-cds
In this project given the discounting factor curve and the bond price from an issuer we derive the spread in asset swap, then we derive the spread over cds curve via interpolation and compare it with the Jarrow-Turnbull approximation and finally price a first to default exploiting Li model with gaussian copula to model the correlation between the obligors.
